Concept Statement:
I am creating an augmented stroke painting experience that would immerse audience in the aesthetics of Chinese calligraphy and painting, in which the physical brushstroke would become the habitats of digital Chinese flowers. As time goes by, the physical brushstroke would also fade away and therefore flowers would scatter, creating a sutble layer of storytelling.  The goal is to explore the relationship between the digital and the physical and experiment with the narrative in that context.

Coding Approach
- Use machine learing for shape and stroke recognition.
- Use  trigonometric functions with polar coordinates to algorithmically generate and animate flowers.
- Particles systems for pettal scattering.
